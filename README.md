I spent approximately 25 hours on this project though a lot of that was because I was sick for most of it.

TA's Derek Benson and Jade Chan were exceptionally helpful in helping with multiple large bugs. As was fellow students Monika Dragulski and Brian Taintor in understanding the outline of this project.

Everything is correctly implemented. The POST API correctly returns all landmarks within 1 mile (1609 meters), the GET API correctly returns all checkins by the given user. The '/' root url, returns a list of recent checkins.

Thank you for the extra time Ming. I apologize for the lateness, I am finally starting to feel better and have spent all weekend trying to catch up, and will continue to do so.
