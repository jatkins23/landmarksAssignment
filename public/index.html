		Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,<br>
		we was sitting in a long and lonesome comp20 lecure.<br>
		All of a sudden, there shined a shiny Ming... in the front... of the class.<br>
		And he said:<br>
		<i>[Sung]</i><br>
		&quot;render the greatest static html page in the world, or I'll eat your soul.&quot; (soul)<br>
		<i>[Spoken]</i><br>
		Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,<br>
		and we each said... &quot;Okay.&quot;<br>
		<i>[Sung]</i><br>
		And we coded the first thing that came to our heads,<br>
		Just so happened to be,<br>
		The Best Static html page in the World, it was The Best static html page in the World.<br>
		<br>
		Look into my eyes and it's easy to see<br>
		One and one make two, two and one make three,<br>
		It was destiny.<br>
		Once every hundred-thousand years or so,<br>
		When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow<br>
		And the grass doth grow...<br>
		<br>
		Needless to say, Ming was stunned.<br>
		Whip-crack went his Whoopy tail,<br>
		And the beast was done.<br>
		Ming asked us: &quot;(snort) Be you angels?&quot;<br>
		And we said, &quot;Nay. We are but men.&quot;<br>
		Rock!<br>
		Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,<br>
		Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!<br>
		<br>
		This is not The Greatest static html page in the World, no.<br>
		This is just a tribute.<br>
		Didn't push my changes to The Greatest static html page in the World, no, no.<br>
		This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest static html page in the World,<br>
		All right! It was The Greatest static html page in the World,<br>
		All right! It was the best muthafuckin' static html page the greatest static html page in the world.<br>
		<i>[2-part skat]</i><br>
		<i>[Spoken]</i><br>
		And the peculiar thing is this my friends:<br>
		the static html page we coded on that fateful night, it didn't actually look<br>
		anything like this static html page.<br>
		<i>[Sung]</i><br>
		This is just a tribute! You gotta believe it!<br>
		And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.<br>
		Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',<br>
		So surprised to find you can't stop it.<br>
		<i>[Skat]</i><br>
		All right! All right!
